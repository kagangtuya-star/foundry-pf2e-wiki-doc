When you first make a PC you will see a completely blank sheet like this

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/230ed1ce-9f6b-4450-98b9-a3a0bb75cd37)

Fill in the details, starting with the standard ABCs of character creation: Ancestry (heritage), Background, Class.

# ABC Items

## Ancestry

To select your ancestry click on the magnifying glass then select your ancestry in the window that comes up, hit the checkbox next to the ancestry to apply it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4919571-0c03-49ad-b1e0-e0c759272f51)

You can search by ancestry name or source to filter down the selections

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f1f9b38-e156-4592-b274-906deb7ec568)

The system will automatically include all ancestries, even one from third party modules. If you select the wrong ancestry, you can either drag the new ancestry to the sheet from compendium or click the 3 dots next to the ancestry on your sheet and delete the ancestry from the actor.

## Heritage

Similar to ancestry you select your heritage by clicking on the magnifying glass. This will automatically filter to heritages for your ancestry + versatile heritages.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1480e0b1-5a5d-422f-9117-23cfbf5c9a1c)

## Background

This is added with the same process as the other ABC items. Here filtering for source can be very useful when making a character for an AP because you can filter for just the player's guide backgrounds for each AP.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f099324-7f63-4feb-8b09-c04d66134df7)

## Class

This is identical to the above ABC items. Often when selecting your class you will be given choices for your class features. Select these now otherwise your class automation may not work.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e76d4450-dffa-4ac5-a45b-d5725604164a)

# Finishing your character

## Changing Visible Tabs

When you are setting up a new character you may finds that you don't need some of the tabs on the sheet. You can hide these by clicking on the 3 dot menu on the right side of the sheet's tabs and unchecking any tabs you don't need.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/449697a6-430a-4cb9-b05d-bffd1c506dd5)

Non-PFS characters, for example, will find little use for the Pathfinder Society tab. Martial characters may not need the spellcasting or crafting tabs. You can re-enable these at any time through the same menu.

## Attribute Modifiers

Once you have your ABC items selected you can set up your character's attributes. Click on the edit button to open the boost manager.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/044c7af9-9430-4f45-9a1b-397cf63c4fe5)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2da73b4-669d-496c-b700-1a800d6f9d31)

Select your boosts at each step. You can use the alternate ancestry boosts (2 free boosts, no flaws) by checking the box next to the ancestry. You can take voluntary flaws if you want, but don't need to select any.

## Languages

Once your attribute modifiers are set you can select the languages your character knows. You can see all of the automatic languages and the open slots on the sheet, and make selections by hitting edit

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/047bf335-523a-4d71-be88-c1371e8bc5f2)

## Skills and Other Proficiencies

The PF2e system will manage many of your proficiencies, setting the saving throw, defense, weapon, and skill proficiencies you automatically get. The system does not currently track how many skill trainings you get on top of these automatic proficiencies (We do plan to tackle this in the future). To set the proficiency on a skill click on the proficiency level and select the rank.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa10a495-7594-4340-b5d3-f6f0c9a49945)

The PF2e system also does not currently support automatically adding lore skills, to add the lore skill from your background or new lores from skill trainings click the add button and type in the lore's name.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3265f925-aecd-41a4-9da0-e8f924461d71)

The system will adopt `[Subject] Lore` as the standard format for lore skills (ie, Architecture Lore, Engineering Lore, Undead Lore, etc), but you can enter anything you want in these text fields. Be aware that when the system does convert to automating lores, the closer you are to the system's standard the less chance the migration to the new structure will fail.

While the system automates weapon proficiencies for you you can add a specific weapon or weapon group as a proficiency. This can be useful for homebrew or if your GM gives you proficiency in a non-standard weapon.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1375ffbe-e23a-4ae9-957f-3865716b1f3b)

## Feats

On the feats and features tab you can see your ancestry and class features, as well as open feat slots. When you click on the magnifying glass next to a feat slot the compendium browser will open and automatically filter to all the feats that can go in that slot.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c39f9674-c04d-464e-8254-2e729903c55c)

Note that you will see options that are rare, such as the reincarnation feats which are ancestry feats available to all ancestries. As you level up more feat slots are added. When selecting class feats at level 2 or higher you will see archetype feats presented as options, you can remove the archetype trait from the filter to remove these if you only want to see feats for your class. By default it will show feats of that slot's level and lower, since you can take lower level feats in a higher level feat slot. You can change the filter settings on the left.

The PF2e system does not and likely never will enforce prerequisites. In the future we may overhaul prereqs and note when you don't qualify for some feats, but we are not likely to prevent you from taking that feat.

## Actions

The actions tab will populate with actions, strikes, and toggles according to the feats and features you have. We do not automatically add all basic or skill actions to sheets, as there are quite a few of these and not all of them will be relevant to every actor. You can find the full list of these in the compendium tab on the sidebar under Character Building and Actions. Basic Actions and Skill Actions are sorted into folders for easy browsing. The unsorted actions in that compendium are specific actions typically granted by feats, features, or from more specific sources.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8f50c93-d1bc-458f-853b-c835d5f9110e)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de87ebab-c7de-43e8-874c-d37f96fc7a6d)

The actions tab also has 3 subtabs for the three different game modes: Encounter, Exploration, and Downtime

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16a0b0a8-ed96-44b3-8ac6-933fb75746ba)

Most actions with associated rolls will have an inline button you can click to roll the associated skill against the appropriate DC.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ee43388-7671-4e2f-8b77-155e58f95eae)

The disarm action, for example, will roll your athletics against the targeted creature's Reflex DC ('T' or double right-click on a token to target them). This will have an output in the chatlog with the text of the correct outcome. Players may or may not see the outcome automatically depending on the settings the GM has set for metagame information.

## Inventory

The inventory tab lets you manage your actor's equipment. Clicking on the magnifying glass next to any category opens the compendium browser for that category. To take an item for free just drag it from the browser to your sheet. To have the system automatically deduct money for the item click on the coin stack icon to buy the item. You can add currency to your sheet from the top of the inventory tab.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54022b21-7bf6-4637-8d3f-04b86b0fdffc)

Once you have an item in your inventory you need to equip them to their proper usage

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cf32ed2-031e-4b8d-aeda-31f1f0b5f6b5)

For items like armor, the system distinguishes from equipped as armor and just "worn" (ie, on your person but not stowed). The slot an item needs to be in is determined by its usage. Some items also have the invested trait. To invest an item click on the diamond icon next to the equip mode. The system will automatically equip any invested item.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8697f2eb-5c18-4eaa-8333-ed747b48fb59)

When you find runes for weapons, armor, and shields you can set those on the details tab of the items.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f804cc99-e449-4872-bd12-767793d441d6)

The system will calculate the price and level of the item automatically as you add runes and special materials. The specific magic weapon/armor checkboxes lock the level, price, and property runes for the item. Below the runes section is the base weapon damage, you should not need to use these fields. The additional custom damage should also not be needed, and rule elements are the preferred way to add additional damage to weapons on top of what is given by the weapon's base damage and runes.

Currently, fundamental runes are automated for weapons, armor, and shields. Weapon property runes are automated, but property runes for armor and shields are not. Improving this is on the near-future roadmap for the system.

## Spellcasting

The system does not currently manage your spells or spellcasting entries. There are several technical hurdles to accomplishing this, but it is a long term goal for the system to automate this. Until we finish that you will need to manage your spell slots manually.

To make a spellcasting entry hit the add button then select your spellcasting type and tradition.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aeb99baa-dfad-4546-8c0b-af9fc43088cd)

**The proficiency will nearly always be Spell Attack Modifiers and DCs, not Class DC.** Class DC is used almost exclusively by Thaumaturge.

The four spellcasting types are Prepared, Spontaneous, Innate, and Focus.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e38cd0b-15df-4229-af48-d946d82f53b2)

Innate spells typically come from ancestry features, not class features. Focus spells are granted by class feats and features.

Prepared casters prepare their spells each day and have some form of spellbook. Paizo does not use the word "spontaneous" in any of the spontaneous class descriptions, but spontaneous casters have a spell repertoire they cast from. For convenience here are the spellcasting classes and their spellcasting type and tradition listed for you.

**Prepared Caster Classes**:
- Cleric (Divine)
- Druid (Primal)
- Magus (Arcane)
- Witch (Determined by Patron choice)
- Wizard (Arcane)

**Spontaneous Caster Classes**:
- Bard (Occult)
- Oracle (Divine)
- Psychic (Occult)
- Sorcerer (Determined by Bloodline choice)
- Summoner (Determined by Eidolon choice)

The other casting class, Animist, is a more complicated caster with elements of both a prepared spellcaster and a spontaneous spellcaster. See the Animist specific section for more on setting up an animist.

### Prepared casters

Once you have a prepared spellcasting entry set the number of slots next to each rank to create empty spell slots. Clicking the spell preparation button opens your spells known list (Your spellbook, familiar, etc). Like equipment or feats clicking on the magnifying glasses opens the compendium browser to preset filters for that spell rank / type.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d2618b5-d59e-4517-a68c-ee7e55621477)

Once you have spells in your spells known list you can drag them into the slots to prepare them. If you want to prepare a single spell multiple times drag it into multiple slots.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d92fc7b7-a2a3-4c50-9f98-f1894943de1d)

Classes like Druid and Cleric may know all common spells at a given rank. **It is not advisable to add all of those spells to your actor**. Spells in your preparation list are stored in actor data, so adding dozens of spells at each rank bloats the actor, which can slow down processing for all players. For those classes treat the spells known list as a short list of spells you are likely to prepare, rather than creating a long list full of options you won't use that slows down the game.

As you cast spells the prepared spell will automatically be expended. You can recover that spell into the slot by clicking on the + button to the right of cast.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6db31d10-9ffd-4053-b7ca-225cfaf88d68)

Resting for the night will automatically re-prepare all of your spells.

When making a prepared spellcaster, you will see an option for flexible spellcaster, this is for character who have taken the flexible spellcaster class archetype.

### Spontaneous Casters

Spontaneous casters do not prepare their spells. They can freely cast from their repertoire using their available spell slots at each rank.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/032d3c54-5386-43dc-ae4b-22eaa22c390a)

Set the spell slots in the field next to each rank and drag spells into those ranks. When you hit the cast button the spell slots will decrement automatically. Resting for the night will automatically recover all spell slots to their maximum.

### Focus Spells

Focus spell entries track the number of focus points for you automatically. You have a number of focus points equal to the number of non-cantrip focus spells you know (to a maximum of 3 points).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30def5eb-637f-47da-82fb-c418d8627e9b)

Casting a focus spell will automatically heighten it and consume a focus point. To recover a focus point manually you can left click on the focus pool. Right clicking the focus pool spends a point. Resting for the night automatically restores all focus points. Some focus spells are focus cantrips. These do not add focus points to your max or consume any focus points on cast (Psychic focus cantrips can consume points, see the building a psychic section for details on this).

### Innate Spells

Innate spells differ from spontaneous spells in that each spell has a number of uses per day. These are normally granted by ancestry feats, though some archetype or class feats may add some.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/608153eb-feab-4ff8-9d80-708c3b40e0dc)

A useful button for innate spells is the toggle visibility button next to the edit and trash icons in the spell entry header. This will hide any empty ranks, condensing the spell entry to something more manageable for a character with only a few innate spells.

### Heightening Spells

To heighten any spell simply drag it to a higher rank slot than its base. This works for any spellcasting type (cantrips and focus spells automatically heighten to the highest rank for your character level). Do not edit the spell's rank on the spell item itself, as that is what sets the base rank of the spell.

### Other Spellcasting tabs

In addition to the known spells tab there are spellcasting tabs for rituals and activations.

#### Rituals

The rituals tab holds the rituals your character knows. You do not need to create a spellcasting entry, and features that grant you specific rituals automatically add them to your rituals known list.

#### Activations

This tab automatically fills in with the wands and scrolls your character is holding. There is currently no support for other item types to add entries to this tab in the system.

## Crafting

Navigate to the Crafting tab on the character sheet.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c79dc83-26b9-43a9-99e5-be91b886c7dc)

Drag any items into the Known Formulas section.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f8276f8-0953-48b6-838d-32b6b91f1add)

Click the Craft button to prompt a Crafting Check. The results will display in the Chat messages. On a Success, additional prompts will detail the crafting cost and total time needed.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68f11615-d146-4bc5-a667-a08d8cae2576)

Choose an option to confirm. The funds will be deducted, and the items will be placed in your character's inventory.

**Advanced Alchemy**
The Alchemist class and certain feats grant Advanced Alchemy benefits. Click on *Empty Slot* in the Advanced Alchemy tab to add items.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27407380-7c58-4bff-a020-e1acefcd5d98)

You can add different items or increase the quantity to craft more of the same item. Once all items are added, click on *Perform Daily Crafting*. The crafted items will appear in your character's inventory.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d947497-7844-4ddb-8c42-b578f1168d67)

# Specific Classes

Here are guides and advice for using each class in Foundry.

## Alchemist

As an alchemist, you'll need to get comfortable with the Crafting tab. Navigate to it as shown in the screenshot, and start by adding some formulas. Click on the "Browse" button, shown in the screenshot.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59e114e6-cb60-405f-96e6-dcb8988ac06c)

This will open the compendium browser — use the filters on the left side to narrow down which formulas you want to add. For example, here we filter for common 1st-level alchemical items, the formulas of which we obtain from Alchemical Crafting.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9796dcc5-4f86-422e-a757-74c49e922386)

You can expand "Inventory Types" and further filter down to, say, consumable items. When you're ready to add a formula, drag it from the Compendium Browser to the Known Formulas area. They will be added to your list and reverse ordered by level.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f106b8f9-fe0d-4393-ad13-b3f8dcef8299)

Keep in mind that the DC, Cost, Quantity columns, as well as the "Craft" button to the right of the Elixir of Life formula are there for the purposes of the Craft activity that any character can do. In order to perform your alchemist's Advanced Alchemy and Quick Alchemy, you will want to keep reading.

#### Advanced Alchemy

Above your Known Formulas is the Daily Crafting section, where you can find a box for Advanced Alchemy. There are two methods for adding formulas to this box.

- The first is by simply drag and dropping an item from your Known Formulas.
- The second is by clicking on an Empty Slot in your Advanced Alchemy list. This will pop-up a window with your known formulas, filtered down to only the items you can create with Advanced Alchemy. Notice how the Potency Crystal and Weapon Siphon in our formula list are not shown (see image below).
  
You can click on the checkmark to the right of an item to add it to your Advanced Alchemy list. Notice how the checkmark next to Giant Centipede Venom is highlighted? This is to indicate that the formula is already added, and you can click on that checkmark to remove it from the list instead.
  
While drag and dropping may seem easier, as your number of formulas grow—both alchemical and non-alchemical—the second method will prove most useful in actual play.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd71bb17-7265-45f8-8c77-7c3a78315a52)

However you add an item to the Advanced Alchemy list, you can then adjust the number of each of them you want to create with the – and +  buttons. You can also remove formulas from the list here by clicking the trash can icon to the right.

Once you're happy with your Advanced Alchemy list, you can click on the Perform Daily Crafting button and you'll receive the items you wanted in the specified quantities in your inventory tab. They will have information icons on them indicating that they are temporary items, on account of their infused trait.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19c712d5-e1c9-46ac-9800-64fc30fbab2d)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2be70361-65c2-4d3e-a099-8a265c2e533d)

When you Rest for the Night, the items will disappear from your inventory but remain in your Advanced Alchemy list, allowing you to make changes as you wish, without having to do everything all over again.

#### Quick Alchemy

*Note: The **Quick Vial** option of Quick Alchemy is not automate*d at the time of writing. This section is merely about the **Create Consumable** portion.

Navigate to the Actions tab, and you will see the Quick Alchemy action. Click on "Use" and this will open a pop-up similar to the one we saw before. Here you will see your formula list, filtered down to all the items you can make with Quick Alchemy (i.e. alchemical consumables).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80e7bacd-e321-4089-b570-558fb2cfae44)

In order to create an item, simply click on the checkmark to the right of its entry. The item will appear in your inventory, and if it was an alchemical bomb, under your Strikes in the action tab as well. This will also consume a versatile vial, which we will learn more about now.

On the left side of your character sheet you can see a section called "Special Resources", and among them are your Versatile Vials, the number of them you have currently, and the number of them you start with each day.

Your current number of versatile vials in Special Resources is based on the number of physical versatile vials you have in your inventory tab.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4007acd4-e0eb-476e-b876-67da3dd31f4f)

In order to add more, you can either edit the number in the Special Resources field, or add them by clicking the + button to the right of the versatile vials in your inventory tab. You may want to do this to add the versatile vials you recover every 10 minutes during exploration, for example.

When you Rest for the Night, your Versatile Vials are restored automatically.

## Animist

Animist is a [prepared](#prepared-casters) divine spellcaster and a [spontaneous](#spontaneous-casters) primal spellcaster that uses Wisdom as their spellcasting attribute modifier. You will need to set up separate spellcasting entries for each of these. There is no native support for apparition attunment. Any spells and lores granted by attuned apparitions need to be added manually. 

The [PF2e Dailies](https://github.com/reonZ/pf2e-dailies) module contains tools to help with managing your apparition spells and lore skills.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bbccbd9-7f13-4623-aeeb-0366b717bf56)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d800931-677a-492c-a422-1321ce0ecbea)

## Barbarian

When you select barbarian you will be asked to pick your instinct. To rage click on use next to the rage action and hit apply effect in chat. Your temporary hit points

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/006d1b41-091f-46a6-b846-1c35be59d7b4)

Most of these are straightforward, once you select them you will get the instinct and its abilities automatically. For some instincts such as Spirit Instinct there will be a new toggle on your actions tab to enable the increased rage damage. You can choose to turn the increased damage off and take the base 2 rage damage instead by unchecking this box. You would want to take the reduced damage bonus in fights where the enemy is immune to the damage type of rage, for example Spirit Instinct would want to use the reduced bonus for fights with constructs who are immune to spirit damage.

Animal Instinct barbarians are granted their unarmed instinct strike when they are raging.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4a937e-e014-44fd-87e0-faed32dd38e3)

Giant Instinct only gets their damage bonus when using an oversized weapon. You can change the size of a weapon by editing the weapon on your sheet. By default items from the compendium browser are added to your sheet at the right size for your actor. Effects like Enlarge will resize your equipment automatically, preserving the size difference if there is one.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99eb80dc-1996-4d51-ab4b-d16ba6bc3395)

## Bard

Bards are [spontaneous](#spontaneous-casters) occult spellcasters who use charisma for their spellcasting attribute.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19bc07b1-9b1e-46c8-b51b-d83ed97bf0cd)

You will also need to add an occult focus entry for your focus spells: Courageous Anthem, Counter Performance, plus any focus spells from your choice of muse such as Lingering Composition.

The system does not currently have dynamic durations for effects, so spells like Lingering Composition are not automated. The [PF2e Workbench](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/xdy-pf2e-workbench) module has a macro to handle modifying the effect durations and the bonuses for your composition effects for Lingering Composition and Fortissimo Composition.

## Champion

When you select champion you will be asked to select a deity, which determines your choice of sanctification and cause. The causes will be restricted to causes that deity and sanctification supports, meaning you cannot choose to be a Champion of Sarenrae and then select the Iniquity cause. You will also have a choice of Blessing. Your blessing may have a linked effect. Dragging this effect to your actor sheet or token lets you choose the specifics of your blessing for the day.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84cf8a1d-eb74-43d8-9740-370bd3663d6a)

Similarly your Champion reaction will have an effect linked in the description to drag onto your allies or enemies, depending on which cause you chose.

## Cleric

Cleric is a [prepared](#prepared-casters) divine spellcaster with Wisdom as their casting attribute.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad1aa99-8605-4da5-ae12-12afebba19e4)

The Divine Font feature grants you additional spell slots at your highest rank to prepare Heal/Harm (Depending on your deity. Or Bane/Bless for Battle Creed clerics). There are two popular ways to set up these slots. The first is to simply add the additional slots to your prepared entry and fill them with the appropriate spell.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/982e5fa4-d9b6-4d63-986d-3481808ae84f)

Another option is to use a separate spontaneous spell entry just for your font. Note that you can rename the spellcasting entry for easier tracking, and collapse the spell rank display to the left of the edit button on the entry header.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2100926-e9b2-4bed-b747-44f7b6b2bd5b)

Which method you choose is up to you.

## Druid

Druid is a [prepared](#prepared-casters) primal caster who uses Wisdom as their spellcasting attribute.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b5ff292-d355-4f30-b89f-0e8b51e8cb56)

For Untamed Order when you cast the Untamed Form focus spell then drag the spell effect to your actor you will be given a choice of any form available to you, which automatically expands as the spell is heightened and as you take additional Druid feats such as Soaring Form. It is important to cast the spell and drag the effect from chat, as that is what collects the context for heightening and the additional forms available to you.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbc35406-2aea-4604-b569-e2f1fc93b2ec)

For advice on animal companions see the [companions](#companions) section.

## Exemplar

When you create an exemplar you will be asked to select your ikons, and in the case of physical ikons like a weapon ikon you can select whether to choose an existing item in your inventory or be given a new item. Once you have finished your selections you can select where your divine spark is between all of your ikons. If you have more than one epithet you can also select the epithet to use. Specific ikons have toggles to enable some of their automation as well.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0faca361-0074-4acd-aea5-e6b79e2d11c3)

## Fighter

Fighters are very straightforward to build in Foundry. As you level you will be asked to select the weapon groups you focus on. At level 9 and 15 you gain the Combat Flexibility and Improved Flexibility features. These grant you temporary feats you can swap out each day. The system has no support for these semi-permanent choices currently beyond adding the feats as bonus feats. The [PF2e Dailies](https://github.com/reonZ/pf2e-dailies) module has features to help with these choices.

## Gunslinger

Similar to Fighter, Gunslinger is straightforward to build in Foundry. The system does not track whether you have reloaded your weapons, and some people prefer to use a module such as [PF2e Ranged Combat](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-ranged-combat) to track this. Be aware that that module enforces reloading for all ranged weapons which some groups find disruptive.

## Inventor

When making an inventor you will be prompted to choose your innovation. If you select Armor or Weapon, you'll be prompted to make additional choices:

Armor: Choose between a Power Suit or a Subterfuge Suit.
Weapon: Select your weapon innovation from the list of available base weapons in the system.
After making your initial selection, you'll be prompted to choose the innovation's initial modification.

Once all selections are complete, the item will automatically appear in your character’s inventory.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef47dec5-7a07-4d80-b83e-914f7f36f4ef)

Choosing the Construct innovation does not prompt additional choices. Instead, you'll need to set up a separate character to represent your Construct Companion. See the [companions](#companions) section for how to make a construct companion.

**Overdrive**

Overdrive is automated as an effect in the system. For features that let you put your overdrive on another actor, such as your construct companion, sending the overdrive to chat then dragging it to another token uses your intelligence modifier rather than theirs, but dragging from your sheet to another actor will not. This is because the act of sending it to chat is what sets the data for the effect to use for other actors.

**Unstable Action and Failures**

Abilities or actions with the Unstable trait will include a prompt for the flat check. If the check fails, you can apply the Unstable Check Failure effect to your character sheet. This effect will add a note to any abilities or actions involving the Unstable trait.

If you have a feat, action, or ability that allows the use of Unstable Functions, you can enable these via a toggle on the character sheet.

## Investigator

Investigator's Devise a Stratagem is automated in the system by an effect that stores a die roll. When you apply this effect you will be asked to target a creature (It will automatically use your existing target if you have one). Then your next attack roll against that creature this round will use the rolled value. Once you make this strike the effect falls off automatically.

## Kineticist

Kineticist's blasts and impulses are automated in the system, but to use them you must first channel your elements. Hit the use button on Channel Elements and apply the effect. This will add the blasts to your attacks. You can select one or two actions at the top of the actions tab. The first line of the blast is the melee form, and the second line is the ranged form.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/989d01c9-74ad-40e9-a818-20ad0e80b244)

Impulses make heavy use of inline automation, meaning the automation is in the text of the action.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c41bb50-b29a-4ae2-b02f-8d37d8e3b738)

Hitting the chat icon next to the save button sends it to chat for the GM to use to roll automatically, alternative the entire action text can be sent to chat, helpful for new things or when you would need to also provide the GM with a quick link to conditions or effects such as Prone that they can drag onto NPCs. Damage is rolled from the inline buttons and clicking on the inline template buttons lets you place a template on the map (control and shift-scroll lets you rotate the template. Be aware that the system does not enforce proper placement according to the PF2e rules (ie, bursts must be centered on an intersection). Feats such as weapon infusion are automated with effects that prompt for selection when applied.

## Magus

Magus is a bounded [prepared](#prepared-spellcasters) arcane spellcaster that uses Intelligence as their spellcasting attribute. To enter Arcane Cascade stance click the use button under Arcane Cascade from the actions tab. There is currently no system support for Spellstrike beyond making a strike and casting the spell separately. The [PF2e Workbench](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/xdy-pf2e-workbench) module contains a macro that helps with Spellstrike automation.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a958283-dc47-4056-aed1-0b3d400c4d60)

## Monk

Monks get a special Fist strike in addition to the generic Unarmed Strike all characters get. You can choose to hide the default Unarmed Strike by clicking on Configure at the top of the actor sheet and unchecking show basic unarmed attack.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeef2bf9-35a9-4b08-b66e-356444404cdb)

Monk stances appear on the actions tab, and using them lets you apply the stance effect. If the stance restricts your strikes to just the stance strikes the system will hide all other strikes while in the stance.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80ef3303-c4e3-46cb-bf39-14d60d228d54)

## Oracle

Oracle is a [spontaneous](#spontaneous-casters) divine caster who uses Charisma as their spellcasting attribute.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fddd337-7f53-46bb-8438-72d2835ec330)

You will also want a focus entry for your focus spells.

Each oracle mystery is automated by adding the Cursebound conditions to the actor. You can increment the Cursebound value by ight clicking on the condition icon in the effects panel (top right of the screen when you have the token selected), or on the effects tab of your character sheet.

## Psychic

Psychic is a [spontaneous](#spontaneous-casters) occult caster who uses either Intelligence or Charisma as their spellcasting attribute (Determined by your choice of Subconscious Mind).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72a8583f-b8a3-4b84-bb97-3fa159a32095)

You do not need special versions of the spells for Psychic (If you are using the old Amps module, uninstall it). The system dynamically modifies the spells when you cast them from the appropriate spellcasting entry. **To amp a cantrip be sure it is in an occult focus entry**. An occult spontaneous entry can also be used, but focus point tracking requires a focus entry. When you have the Amp Psi Cantrips toggle set casting these cantrips will use a focus point and modify the spell, changing the damage, effect, or adding to the description of the spell as needed.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b02729c9-c932-45a5-8140-8870fc637c7e)

Alternative amps similarly have a toggle set on the spellcasting tab of the actor.

## Ranger

When you create a Range you will select your Hunter's Edge, which determines the effect of your Hunt Prey action. The system currently uses toggles for Hunt Prey, but we are close to being able to use a proper effect system that would let you mark a token or creature for improved automation.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a585899-c6df-4839-bbfa-3e978dcf2895)

If you take an Animal Companion see the [companions](#companions) section for how to set them up.

## Rogue

After selecting your racket the system will set up all of your features automatically. The system automates flanking and features like Surprise Attack. If you are having trouble with flanking automation the most likely culprit is flanking with non-allies, or using a map without a 5 foot square grid. Make sure the GM has set any allied NPCs as allies in the configuration. Once you reach level 9 your Debilitating Strikes feature will add a toggle to the top of your actions tab. Taking additional feats that add new debilitations will add them as choices to this dropdown.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69431f92-1724-4072-a3ed-337a4f8d0dc2)

## Sorcerer

Sorcerer is a spontaneous caster who uses Charisma as their spellcasting attribute. Your spellcasting tradition is determined by your choice of bloodline.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92cf9b2a-d6c9-401f-b4c6-9e0b4aec2c2d)

Sorcerous Potency is a toggle at the top of the spellcasting tab, this is not automatically on for all spells because the effect does not apply to ongoing damage, only the initial damage for a spell, so you need a way to disable the bonus. Your bloodline's blood magic effects will be added as notes or alterations to your spells automatically. If you take any alternate blood magic feats you can select which blood magic to use with a toggle at the top of the spellcasting tab.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36f31558-dd21-491b-97b3-74583d623153)

## Summoner

Summoner is a bounded [spontaneous](#spontaneous-casters) caster who uses Charisma as their spellcasting attribute. Your spellcasting tradition is determined by your choice of Eidolon. For creating your eidolon see the [companions](#companions) section.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92cf9b2a-d6c9-401f-b4c6-9e0b4aec2c2d)

The system does not have a way to tie two actors together currently, but the [PF2e Toolbelt](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-toolbelt) contains some tools for sharing data between an eidolon and their master.

## Swashbuckler

When you select a Swashbuckler Style the system will automatically add the bravado traits to the appropriate actions. When you succeed with an action with the bravado trait you will see a note giving you a link to the panache effect to drag onto the actor. When using actions be sure to use the inline buttons on the action item and have a creature targeted, this ensures the system knows the outcome and can give you the right outcome message.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f29637-28bf-4c98-81e5-ff911d217ab6)

Your finisher can be selected from the top of the actions tab, and once toggled on it will automate the effects of that finisher. Each finisher you have the feat for is added to the dropdown automatically.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60735f26-1678-425f-bfa4-7d44fe1bd820)

## Thaumaturge

When you select thaumaturge, you will be prompted to choose an implement. This will add an item your inventory, which will be associated with your implement benefits.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e85d3f1e-191f-4208-9565-69ea1d0eef10)

At level 5 and 15, you will choose your second and third implements respectively. At level 7, 11 and 17, you will be prompted for your implement improvements.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/114b64b7-8047-4613-a3cf-4f15c2aa0245)

In order to use implement features and abilities, they must be held in hand.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/918f1ee0-03b1-4bb8-8c29-f6c1328b9510)

**Weapon Implement** The system presents you with every non-magical weapon from the compendium by default. If you want a specific magic weapon (or a customized weapon) to be your implement, when prompted to choose a weapon, you can instead drag any weapon from the items sidebar or from the compendium to the homebrew item drop zone on the selector prompt.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ad58fef-863c-43c2-b3a8-cf0a86794857)

The system does not currently support selecting weapons already on the actor as their weapon implements, only from compendium or the item sidebar. Once you select the implement the system will add it to your actor and tag it with the implement information automatically.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/721a4071-3993-4356-ba46-b4906e6e8e86)

There is no native support for Exploit Vulnerability. The [PF2e Exploit Vulnerability](https://github.com/mysurvive/pf2e-thaum-vuln/) module contains tools to help with this and other Thaumaturge-related automation.

## Witch

Wizard is a [prepared](#prepared-casters) caster who uses intelligence as their casting attribute. The tradition you select will depend on your familiar.  See the [familiars](#familiars) section for setting up your familiar. Track your spells on your Witch actor, not the familiar actor. Your hex spells will be modified to note your familiar's ability automatically by the system.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0307a20d-f077-4993-8034-426dcb9fc348)

## Wizard

Wizard is a [prepared](#prepared-casters) arcane caster who uses intelligence as their casting attribute. You will select your arcane school and thesis when making your character. If you choose spellshape feats you will find spellshape toggles at the top of your spellcasting tab.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0307a20d-f077-4993-8034-426dcb9fc348)

## Playtest Classes

To play as any class currently in playtest (Starfinder 2e, Commander, Necromancer, etc) install the appropriate playtest moodule (Both are free and made by us system devs!). For Starfinder playtest that is the [Starfinder 2e Playtest](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e) module and for PF2e playtests that is the [PF2e Playtest Data](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-playtest-data) module. This wiki does not have guides for individual playtest classes, and playtest automation methods are subject to change when the full classes are released.

# Companions

Animal companions, construct companions, and eidolons are handled by the [PF2e Companion Compendia module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pf2e-animal-companions). For how-to instructions for using that module see the module's [github page](https://github.com/TikaelSol/PF2e-Animal-Companions).

## Familiars

For familiars make a new familiar actor on the actors sidebar, then select which master is associated with that familiar. You can find familiar abilities in the compendium tab in the familiar abilities compendium. The system currently has no support for specific familiars. We also do not currently support familiars making strikes.

A Witch's familiar acts as their spellbook, but the tracking of spells known should be done on the Witch, not on the familiar actor.

# Leveling Up
You can alter your character's level in the top right corner of the sheet. The following things will be handled automatically:
* HP increase
* Class features
* New feat slots
* Proficiency increases

You need to do the rest manually:
* Add spells and spell slots 
* Select new boosts in the attribute manager at the appropriate levels.
* Add feats into your new slots

# Dual Class PCs
There's a setting the GM can enable to allow for dual class PCs in the [PF2e Workbench](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/xdy-pf2e-workbench) module, but it only adds extra feat slots. To make it work more smoothly, the easiest way is to use the dual class macro included in the PF2e Workbench module. You can also get the [macro directly from Symon's gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/symonsch/my-foundryvtt-macros/-/blob/main/PF2e/Dual%20Class.js).

If you do not want to use the macro you should do the following:
* Import the class you want to use as the base into your world.
* Add the second class's features onto the main class's details tab by dragging and dropping from the Class Features compendium (you might find the Quick Insert module really handy here)
* Add a roll option rules element to the main class which has the name of the second class. This will allow features like Sneak Attack to work properly, as otherwise Foundry won't realize that you also have this class. An example of the roll option rules element would be - just replace `rogue` with the name of the second class:
```json
{
    "key": "RollOption",
    "domain": "all",
    "option": "class:rogue",
    "priority": 0
}
```
Then drag the new dual class item onto your actor from the items sidebar.
