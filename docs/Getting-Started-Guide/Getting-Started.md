This guide assumes you're already familiar with the basics of Foundry, like how to set up scenes, create actors and so on. Instead, this guide is about how to use Pathfinder 2 in Foundry. The system is continually being updated, and so this guide will probably always be a bit out of date. For the latest state, come ask in Discord!

[Making a PC](https://github.com/foundryvtt/pf2e/wiki/Making-a-PC), which covers how to make a PC, animal companion or familiar, and how items work.

[GM's Page](https://github.com/foundryvtt/pf2e/wiki/GM's-Starter-Guide) which covers how to make NCPs, hazards, loot actors, merchants and how to run combat.

There's a few Pathfinder 2-specific tricks in Foundry:
- You can Shift click the apply damage/healing buttons on all non-check rolls to adjust the actually taken damage/healing. Useful for weaknesses and resistances.
- You can Shift click on any button to skip the detailed roll dialogue (or make it appear, if you've set the default to off)
- You can Control click on any button to make it a blind GM roll
- Control and right click will delete an item, effect or feat without asking you for confirmation
